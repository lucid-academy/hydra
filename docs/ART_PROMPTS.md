# Prompty do grafik (GPT)

Gotowe prompty do generatora obrazów w GPT. Każdy jest w osobnym bloku, do skopiowania w całości, i każdy zaczyna się od tego samego stałego bloku stylu (test pilnuje, żeby tak zostało).

## Jak z nich korzystać

1. Skopiuj cały blok i wklej do GPT. Jeśli wynik się nie podoba, dopisz poprawkę zwykłymi słowami („remove the shadow", „more contrast", „make the pixels bigger") albo wygeneruj od nowa.
2. Pobierz obrazek (PNG, rozmiar z GPT jest w porządku, skrypt i tak go zmniejszy) i nazwij go dokładnie tak jak w nagłówku, np. `texture_ground_lairSwamp_mud.png`.
3. Wyślij go w wątku projektu Hydra albo wrzuć na GitHubie do folderu `art/raw/`. Oryginałów nikt potem nie zmienia.
4. Skrypt `npm run art` wycina tło, zmniejsza obrazek do rozmiaru gry, wstawia go do gry i zgłasza problemy.

Na co uważać:

- **Tekstury gruntu i skał** wypełniają cały kwadrat, od krawędzi do krawędzi, widziane prosto z góry, bez magenty. Gra sama spłaszcza je do kąta kamery i wycina z nich heksy, więc nie proś GPT o heksy.
- **Wszystko inne** stoi na jednolitym tle magenta `#FF00FF`. Bez cienia na tle, bez podłogi, bez ramki. Jeśli GPT doda cień albo inne tło, poproś o poprawkę.
- **Głowa** to dwa osobne kawałki (głowa i żuchwa), które nie mogą się stykać.
- Rozmiary w promptach to rozmiary w grze. GPT ich nie dotrzyma i nie musi; chodzi o to, żeby rysował prosto i grubymi pikselami, bo drobne szczegóły i tak znikną po zmniejszeniu.

## Stały blok stylu

Pixel art game asset for "Hydra", a dark fantasy roguelite about a hydra from an underground swamp. Crisp low-resolution pixel art with big, clearly visible square pixels: no anti-aliasing, no blur, no soft gradients (dithering only), no text, no signature, no frame, no border.
Colours: a cold, dark underground of near-black #05090a, deep teal #0e3b3f, swamp green #2f4a2a and sickly yellow-green bioluminescence #c6e04a; the Order of the Eternal Flame brings warm gold #d9a93b, orange #e0702a, banner red #9e2323 and fire #ffcf5c; mist is pale greenish grey #a9b8a8. Muted and dark overall, only glows and fire are bright.
Camera: one angle for the whole game, a three-quarter view from above, about 45 degrees above the ground; light from the upper left.
Background: one flat, solid magenta #FF00FF everywhere around the subject, with no shadow, gradient or floor on it, unless the request below says the image is a texture that fills the whole picture.

Request: a seamless square ground texture that fills the whole picture edge to edge (no magenta, no border). Seen straight from above, completely flat: no perspective, no horizon, ignore the camera angle for this one.
Subject: murky still water of the swamp around the hydra's lair. Very dark teal-green water (around #12393a), a few small pale ripples, a little green scum and duckweed, a few faint yellow-green glints of floating spores. Even detail spread over the whole square, nothing big in the middle, low contrast, so creatures stay readable on top of it.
Size: drawn as pixel art about 96 by 96 pixels, so keep the shapes chunky: ripples and blobs 2 to 6 pixels big.

Subject: rough, solid cave rock of an underground swamp: dark brownish grey stone (around #3a3129) with cracks, a few wet glints and dark green moss in the cracks. It must read as one solid mass of stone, not as separate stones or tiles. The game uses it for the tops of rock walls and, darkened, for their sides.
Size: drawn as pixel art about 96 by 96 pixels, so keep the shapes chunky: cracks and patches 2 to 8 pixels big.

Request: one game sprite, centred, on the flat magenta background.
Subject: the torso of a giant swamp hydra WITHOUT any heads, necks or tail (the game adds the necks and heads). A huge, squat mound of dark green scaly hide, seen in the game's three-quarter view from above: its base is a wide oval about one and a half times as wide as it is deep, and its back rises in a low, heavy dome. Paler, mossy scales on top of the back, darker scales low on the sides, a dark outline. It has no front and no back: necks and enemies surround it on every side, so no face, no legs sticking out, no tail.
Size: in the game it is 132 by 110 pixels, so keep the scales big and the shape bold.

Request: one game sprite in two separate pieces on the flat magenta background, side by side, with a clear gap of magenta between them (they must not touch).
Subject: the head of a swamp hydra in side view, snout pointing RIGHT. Reptilian and a little dragon-like: a long mouth with small teeth, a small crest at the back of the skull, a glowing eye. Draw it ONLY in pale grey and white with a dark outline, no other colours (the game colours each head by its class).
- LEFT piece: the head without its lower jaw (skull, upper jaw with teeth, eye, crest), snout pointing right.
- RIGHT piece: the lower jaw alone, at the same size as it would be on the head, also pointing right.
Size: in the game the whole head is only about 36 by 24 pixels, so keep it simple and bold: a clear silhouette and a few big shapes.

Background: one flat, solid magenta #FF00FF everywhere around the subject, with no shadow, gradient or floor on it, unless the request below says the image is a texture that fills the whole picture.

Request: a seamless square rock texture that fills the whole picture edge to edge (no magenta, no border). Seen straight from above, completely flat: no perspective, no horizon, ignore the camera angle for this one.
Subject: wet, dark grey-blue cave rock (around #2e3436), smooth and water-worn, glistening with a few pale highlights, thin cracks. It must read as one solid mass of stone, not as separate stones or tiles. The game uses it for the tops of rock walls and, darkened, for their sides.
Size: drawn as pixel art about 96 by 96 pixels, so keep the shapes chunky: cracks and patches 2 to 8 pixels big.

Muted and dark overall, only glows and fire are bright.
Camera: one angle for the whole game, a three-quarter view from above, about 45 degrees above the ground; light from the upper left.
Background: one flat, solid magenta #FF00FF everywhere around the subject, with no shadow, gradient or floor on it, unless the request below says the image is a texture that fills the whole picture.

Request: a dialogue portrait, a bust (head and shoulders), on the flat magenta background. Portraits are a separate shot: ignore the game camera, show her from the front, turned slightly to the side.
Subject: Old Mother Toad, the ancient guardian of the hydra's lair and its mentor, who has buried eleven generations of hydras. An enormous, very old swamp toad: wrinkled, warty olive-green skin, moss and lichen on her back, heavy half-closed eyes with yellow-green irises, a necklace of small bones and shells. Expression: deadpan, unimpressed, a little tired. A faint yellow-green glow of spores around her.
Size: in the game the portrait is 128 by 160 pixels, so keep the shapes bold and readable.
